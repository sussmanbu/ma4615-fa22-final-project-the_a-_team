<h2><strong>Analysis for EDA (top two airline emissions): </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>air_trend: Firstly, I calculated the proportion of the source of emissions in the airline industry and chose the top five elements which contribute most to the emission of CO2 between 2014 and 2019. I did that by using the code ‘count()’, ‘arrange()’, and ‘head()’. Then, I use the top five elements to plot the relationship between the element and total emission. Surprisingly, I found that there was an obvious increase during 2018 for all these elements. We assume that the airline industry may contribute a larger proportion in 2018 than we previously assumed.</li>

<h2><strong>Analysis for EDA (Agricultral elements trend): </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>In this graph, as the numbers of source_of_emissions are too many to conclude in a single graph, we choose five representative ones that can reflect the general trend. Refer to Agricultural Guidance, AFOLU is responsible to approximately 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions.Besides, Emissions on agricultural land, Forest fires, IPCC Agriculture, and Net Forest conversion are most important sectors in agriculture, so we use them to represent source_of_emissions. According to the graph, we can see the emission of every source_of_emissions increases from 2010-2019. Although the rate of increase fluctuates during these years, we can still see the negative influence of these source_of_emissions influence our climate. They negatively inluences our climate by contributing to the increases of our emissions.</li>

<li>Our group combines the data from 2010 to 2019, but for the overall vehicle change trend, it will be better to view in a longer period of time, so in this graph, we select the data from 1994-2019. We use geom_point() to make a scatterplot for all the vehicles (expect air vehicles). Then using geom_line() to connect the points of same vehicle together to see the trend. Some vehicles such as Truck and bus has unstable changes over years, but the overall trend of vehicles is increasing during 1994 to 2019, we hope the result has relationship with the emission amount during 1994 to 2019.</li>

<li>During 1994 to 2008, the emission has the same tendency with the number of vehicle emissions. As number of vehicles increased, the emission amount also increased. However, after 2008, the emission decreased for few years and the number of cars decreased in 2009, and then increased in 2011. so conclusion is the correlation between emissiona and number of vehicles is strong during 1994 to 2008, but it became weak during 2009-2019.</li>

<li>As you can see from the graph, CO2 emissions increased with population growth until 2010. From 2010 to 2013, there was a significant decrease in CO2 emissions, which may be related to the US government’s control of greenhouse gases. After 2013, greenhouse gases are on the rise again.</li>
