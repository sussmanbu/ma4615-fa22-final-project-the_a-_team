## **Data source**

* Global climate change has always been a heated topic worldwide. Since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2015, major countries have taken action to cut CO2 emissions and to operate cleaner and greener. The United States, being the top emitter of CO2 in the world, is an effective representative for us to analyze how far we are in reaching the goal. Therefore, in this project, we will be looking at the CO2 emission trends of the United States in the period `2015 - 2019`. In particular, we will choose flight, agriculture, and vehicle industry as the focal factors in our study.

**Data collection**

* This first dataset comprehensively collects greenhouse gas emissions for countries worldwide. It includes the CO2 emission by different measurements, and we mainly focused on energy use and the total emission amount. We also used the GDP and population included in the dataset. This data set is extracted from the Our World in Data website, and the authors are Hanna Ritchie, Max Roser, and Pablo Rosado. It originally served as a platform to publish data and research to help solve the worldâ€™s problems and reform a better place to live. The data sources for this dataset comes from the official government department and other authoritative organization, including BP, the British multinational energy company; EIA, the U.S. Energy Information Administration; and UN, the united nation. We used this data as a primary focus for the analysis since it provides numerous variables for us to investigate and use as indicators in our model.

**Data cleaning**

* Because we decided to focus on the CO2 emissions from all of the world, we did not filter out any of country. Then, we used `select()` to choose variables we need to predict CO2 emisisons along all years. To make sure no NAs in the dataset, we used `na.omit()`. Finally, we saved the dataset by using `write_csv()` and `save()`.

Each profile includes interactive visualizations, explanations of the presented metrics, and the details on the sources of the data.

**Data collection**

* The second dataset Global emissions from agriculture and forest land are collected by the organization FAOSTAT. This organization provides free access to food and agriculture statistics for over 245 countries and covers all FAO original groupings from 1961 to the most recent year available. In this dataset, FAOSTAT collects data to investigate the main contributions of increasing global greenhouse emissions and tries to solve the crux of environmental issues in the past few decades.


* The FAOSTAT domain Emissions Totals summarize the `greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions` disseminated in the FAOSTAT     Climate Change Emissions domains, generated from agriculture and forest land. They consist of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from crop and livestock activities and forest management and include land use and land-use change processes. Data are computed at Tier 1 of the IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse gas (GHG) Inventories.


**Data cleaning**

* Link: [load_and_clean_data.R](/load_and_clean_data.R)

* After researching the factors that cause the increasing CO2 emissions, I found that `agriculture/land use` is one of the main contributors to CO2 emissions. Analyzing the data on agriculture helps to figure out the trend of CO2 emission. So I found the dataset about agriculture. 

* After exploring the dataset, I first filtered out the time range in order to combine it with the global total greenhouse gas emissions dataset.   We believe that we could conclude the emission trend in twenty years. So we focus on the global data from 1990 to 2018. And then, I filtered the emission element, which is CO2 emission. I chose to focus on one major source of emission to analyze the data, which is the emissions on agricultural land. I selected the columns I needed by `select()`. To make the dataset more organized and easy to read, I renamed several variables to make them coherent with another dataset. Since the original dataset is wide, I changed the format of the dataset by using `pivot_longer`. So that the year becomes the rows and the whole table looks clear and concise. In order to calculate the total value of the emissions, I used the group_by function to categorize several variables and summarized the emission value. In order to left join it with another dataset by country, I changed all the country names, so that the two datasets could combine together by country and year.

Is your country making progress on reducing emissions? We built 207 country profiles which allow you to explore the statistics for every country in the world.

Each profile includes interactive visualizations, explanations of the presented metrics, and the details on the sources of the data.

## **Variables explanation for two datasets**

* Our team focuses on emission situation around the globe, and we dig into small branches/subsets of the emission sources and try of discover a trend. The size of raw data is too broad to focus, so we clean the data and specifically focus on data of emission in 153 countries from1990-2018 to discover a trend. For the first dataset, we selected 8 variables as our primary interest. In the course of our research, we find agriculture a very important source of emission which contributes to 33% of global emissions according to Our World in Data. With great interests to explore more of it, we find data of agriculture as our second dataset and combine it with the first one. 

* For the combined data file, considering variables in terms of columns, we have 11     variables. Then are I will provide explanations for all the 11 variables as below:

  * country: A `country` means a nation. While we use `country` to focus our research to certain geographic locations, we examine emission situation of 153 countries.
 year: We use variable `year` to focus our search on a certain time range. Our years of observation is from 1990-2018.
 
  * gdp: `gdp` is a measure of size and health of economy in each country, and it tells us the gross domestic product in each country. It is calculated by multiplying gdp per capita with population. 

  * population: `population` means the number of inhabitants in a certain country. It is also an important indicator that influences emissions. 

  * energy_per_capita:  `energy_per_capita` represents primary energy consumption per capita, and it is calculated by total primary energy consumption/population.

  * energy_per_gdp: `energy_per_gdp`represents primary energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product, and it is calculated by total primary energy consumption/gross domestic product.

  * primary_energy_consumption: `primary_energy_consumption` measures the total energy demand of a country. It refers to direct use at the source, or supply to users without transformation of crude energy. The consumption process of primary energy will generate emissions to the atmosphere.

  * Source_of_emissions: `source_of_emissions` tells us what kinds of source in agriculture generates emissions. For the agriculture sector, we focus on one `source_of_emissions`, which is Emission on agricultural land.

  * Agriculture_emissions(kilotonnes): It represents the amount of emissions produced by agriculture sector, measured in kilotonnes. `Agriculture_emissions(kilotonnes)`directly corresponds with the emission created by `Source_of_emissions`.

  * total_ghg(kilotonnes): It represents total greenhouse gas emissions including land-use change and forestry, measured in kilotonnes.

  * agri_ghg_total: It represents the sum of emission from `Agriculture_emissions(kilotonnes)` and `total_ghg(kilotonnes)`.
